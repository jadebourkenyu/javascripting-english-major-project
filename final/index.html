            <h2>Book Summary</h2>
                <p> <em>Open City</em> appears to be a plotless book about a Nigerian doctor, Julius. Julius lives near Morningside Park and frequently goes on walks throughout the city. During these walks, he reminisces on his past and thinks in depth about the knowledge he has on various topics like history, art and music. Juilius has, more often than not, negative experiences with other people which unfolds to be a result of his poor attitude and actions. He travels abroad to Brussels towards the middle of the novel. During this excursion his naration continues to be plateaued despite a brief romance with a woman, new walks and sight seeing. When he returns to New York he is unchanged and returns to his routine. The book ends with Julius going to a symphany and explaining the background of the symphany. A prime example of how he, the narrator, goes on these tangents that are almost irrelevent to the stroyline and chracterization. Yet, due to the theme of that in the novel the reader realizes that this novel is not framed around a plot/ storyline but the characterization, or better yet, lack of characterization Julius has. This unique type of novel leaves lots of interpretation for the reader not only about Julius but about the novels bigger meaning as a whole.

            <h4>Analysis</h4>
              <p class="lead">By looking at the map created we can see that Julius walks around all of manhattan. He goes from ths WTC to 181 Street. Julius' character is more of a loner and knowledgable. He seems to know a lot about different places and their history. This coincides with how he's walked throughout Manhattan. As oppose to going over people's houses and getting to know them, he goes to various locations and learns all he can about that place. Some of this information even includes his past experiences there. Even more, it is noted that only one location is a friends house and the term friend is used loosely. Julius does not really consider John to be a friend of his no does he anyone. Every other place is somewhere he goes alones.
                More over, for someone living in NYC and exploring he does not have fun or exciting stories. His dismal personality hinders such experiences. He walks around lower central park and Columbus Circle often which is always crowded with tourists and locals from the Upper West Side, shopping and going to the park. His description of these places always included making a point of saying how many people were there. He did not nescarily have a positive or negative implication when saying this but as a reader it can be derived that he feels that he does not fit in. Especially becasue if he lives and works there why doesn't he go to that area with friends since it is so popular? He doesn't aprreciate the little things like that, which make the city a city. Additionally, refering to the map you can see that places he visits most often are well-populated/ tourit infested areas, like Central Park, Columbus Circle, the Financial District and the World Trade Center. For someone who isn't a people person he likes to be surrounded by them. Maybe this reveals that he likes to be independent but not necessarily "alone". Or, on the other hand, being in big crowds makes him feel more alone or distant which is what he desires, to be excluded for this population or place that he knows so much about. Almost like he is an outsider above (or better than) everyone else just watching, learning and judging. Yet, the map shows that his point at JFK is very far away which can prove that no matter how much he is in NYC, he will always be "out of it"/ not a part of it, socially at least.
              The points on the map truly coincide with his character. </p>
